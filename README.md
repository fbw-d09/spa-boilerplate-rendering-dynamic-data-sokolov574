# `02` Rendering from objects
[![Status overview badge](../../blob/badges/.github/badges/main/badge.svg)](#-results)


Now lets use a more complex variable to render our HTML, let's say we have the following JS Object containing a customer information:

```js
const customer = {
  first_name: 'Bob',
  last_name: 'Dylan',
};
```

To retrieve any property from the `Customer` object we have to use the dot `.` operator like this:

```js
console.log(customer.first_name); // will print "Bob" on the console.
```

# :speech_balloon: Instructions

Open the `App.js` and create the necesary code to make your file render the following output into the DOM:

```jsx
<div>
  <h1>My name is Bob</h1>
  <h2>My last name is Dylan</h2>
</div>
```
